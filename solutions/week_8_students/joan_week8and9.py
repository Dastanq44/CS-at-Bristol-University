#1) Provide a python example of following arithmetic operators:
#Define two numbers
a=10
b=5

#Use addition sybmol to add numbers a and b
addition= a+b
print (f"a + b= {addition}")

#Use subtraction symbol to subtract numbers a and b
subtraction= a-b
print(f"a-b= {subtraction}")

#Use multiplication sybmol to multiply numbers a and b
multiplication=a*b
print(f"a*b= {multiplication}")

#Use division symbol to divide numbers a and b
division=a/b
print(f"a/b= {division}")

#Use the % symbol to find remainder of numbers a and b
modulus=a%b
print(f"a%b= {modulus}")

#Use exponent symbol to find the power of numbers a and b
exponent=a**b
print(f"a**b= {exponent}")

#Use symbols // for numbers a and b
floor_divison=a//b
print(f"a//b= {floor_divison}")

#2) Provide a python example of following assignment operators

x=10
print(f"Initial value of x= {x}")

x+=5
print(f"After +- opertation (x+-5): {x}")

x-=5
print(f"After -= operation (x-=5): {x}")

x*=5
print(f"After *= operation (x*=5): {x} ")

x/=5
print(f"After /= operation (x/=5): {x}")

x%=5
print(f"After %= operaton (x%=5): {x}")

x//=3
print(f"After operation //= (x//=3): {x}")

x**=2
print(f"After operation **=(x**=2): {x}")



#8)assign value 10 to variable a
a=10

#add 5 to a
a+=5

#subtract 3 from a
a-=3

#multiply a by 2
a*=2

#Divide by 4 (use floor division)
a//=4

#print the result of a
print(f"After appplying all the operators, a= {a}")


#9)Define two variables, x=7 and y=12
x=7
y=12
if x>y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("y is greater than x")


if x<=y:
    print("x is less than or equal to y")
else:
    print("x is not less than or equal to y")

if x<y and x!=y:
    print ("x is less than y and is not equal to y")
else:
    print("Either x is not less than y or x is equal to y")

if x>y or y>10:
    print("x is greater than y or y is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than y and y is not greater than 10")

my_list={1,2,3,4,5}

if 3 in my_list:
    print("3 is in my list")
else:
    print("3 is not in my list")

if 10 not in my_list:
    print("10 is not in my list")
else:
    print("10 is on my list")

a=[1,2]
b=[1,2]
if a is b:
    print("a is b")
else:
    ("a is not b")

if a==b:
    print("a==b")
else:
    print("a is not ==b")
